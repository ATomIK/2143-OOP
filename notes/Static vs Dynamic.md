## Static

refers to a property or feature that is bound at compile time and thereafter cannot be modified.

e.g. int i = 5;

## Dynamic

refers to a property or feature that cannot be bound until run time.

e.g. Python
 - can change a variable's type to a string during exec.
 
## Type

**Statically typed languages**

- Type checking can be done at compile time
- Memory layout can be determined at compile time for automatic variables
- EFFICIENCE (?)

**Dynamically typed languages**

- FLEXIBILITY

## trick

```cpp
// prototype
void DoSomething(Employee &e);

Employee * e = new Manager(...);

DoSomething(e);
```

Write a toString method in all your classes that formats and returns a string of the values of the
member data formatted the way you want the main to print them. NOTE: Don’t have SpaceCraft
include the precious metals asteroid list.

Add a string member data called name to SpaceObject to indicate the type of the object and make
sure the toString method returns this type for all subclasses. Modify all the constructors to set
this field. Add a get method to SpaceObject to return this data. The member data and method will be
inherited.

In main, use a typedef and declare an array of pointers to SpaceCraft.

Overload the = operator for the Asteroid class, and use it in any method that needs to assign values
from one asteroid to another, e.g., alist[i] = asteroid; will NOW be a legal statement
and will replace statements like alist[i].setWeight (asteroid.getWeight());

You will need to add a toString method to the AsteroidList class, as well.

Add a getList( ) method to the SpaceCraft class, that calls the toString method of the

AsteroidList, to return one huge string of precious asteroids to print out later. This is essentially a
dump method.
